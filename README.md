## Testin Nextjs with Yarn 4

👉🏻 **First install yarn 4.0.0 following yarn's team instructions:** [see how to update](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

If you have already installed versions up to yarn 1.x, just put this command on your console:
```bash
👉🏻 yarn set version stable
```

## What I am testing
For now this is what I'm testing, but I could try more things.

- [ ] Use SWC in nextjs 13
- [ ] Use yarn 4.0.0 (latest version released)
